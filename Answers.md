1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    Server Side Routing is the traditional way to render pages from a server. When a page is requested, the server renders the page and sends it to the user. If the user clicks another link, server renders a page and send it to the user. SEO is better for this type.

    Client Side Routing sends all the files to the user once. If a user clicks a link, that page is rendered on the users computer, not the server. Makes for fast web browsing on a site.
